## VR Web Examples

A collection of boilerplate web VR scenes from the Mozilla Research VR team. For additional demos, tutorials and resources, visit [mozvr.com](http://mozvr.com)

* [Basic Three.js VR boilerplate](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/threejs-vr-boilerplate/)
* [Mockups on cylinders](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/mockups-on-cylinders/)

To view these examples in virtual reality mode requires a VR-enabled browser and a compatible headset. Currently the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2 are supported, with support for additional devices coming soon.

If using web VR for the first time, make sure to properly configure your display settings, as described on the mozvr.com downloads page [Read Me](http://mozvr.com/downloads). Not doing so can cause the browser to not display VR mode properly or create high levels of judder.

### Controls

* `Double click` or press `F` to enter full-screen virtual reality mode.
* Press `Z` to zero sensor (sets the forward direction of the scene).
